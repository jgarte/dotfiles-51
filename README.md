# Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles for Unix, which in my case is any given Linux distro or OpenBSD. They are catered to a terminal centric workflow using ksh as the shell, xterm as the terminal, and cwm as the window manager. Some files are encrypted.

## Installation

Run bin/install-dotfiles (warning: will overwrite existing files).
